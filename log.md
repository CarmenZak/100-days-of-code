**Today's Progress**: Started the Cat Photo app focussing on html

**Thoughts:** Started the Cat Photo App which is nice and simple and a good refresher in html. I remembered some of the structure but need to make sure I remember to use the > symbol when doing anchor links after the url link!

<Day 2: 19 Nov 2024

**Today's Progress**: Carried on with developing app with html including adding figure captions and creating a form with radio and checkbox buttons.

**Thoughts**: I built on my previous html knowledge by adding in figure captions and creating a form. There are lots of elements to think about with form input (type, id, name, value) so need to practise more.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
