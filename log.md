# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 18 Nov 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started the Cat Photo app focussing on html

**Thoughts:** Started the Cat Photo App which is nice and simple and a good refresher in html. I remembered some of the structure but need to make sure I remember to use the > symbol when doing anchor links after the url link!

### Day 2: 19 Nov 2024

**Today's Progress**: Carried on with developing app with html including adding figure captions and creating a form with radio and checkbox buttons.

**Thoughts**: I built on my previous html knowledge by adding in figure captions and creating a form. There are lots of elements to think about with form input (type, id, name, value) so need to practise more.

### Day 3: 20 Nov 2024

**Today's Progress**: I created a new repo for the Cat Photo App and finished off the app (yay!)by adding `label for` and other elements to format the checkboxes on the form.

**Thoughts** I struggled adding the `label for` element to the checkboxes as I couldnt figure out where they went and when I got it it felt great!

### Day 4: 21 Nov 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started the second project: cafe menu

**Thoughts**: The start (index.html) went well but then I hit problems with css trying to sort out the background-image...syntax errors! I'll get there...
